AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 09–893
In dispute involving the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA ), 9 U. S. C. section 2 et seq., arising from a disputed contract for the sale and servicing of cellular telephones, judgment of the appeals court holding that an arbitration provision that effectively precluded class litigation was unconscionable under the California Supreme Court's decision in Discover Bank v. Superior Court is reversed because Discover Bank is preempted by the FAA.
