Obergefell v. Hodges, 14-556
In a case in which 14 same-sex couples and two men whose same-sex partners are deceased filed suits in Federal District Courts in their home States, claiming that respondent State officials violate the Fourteenth Amendment by denying them the right to marry or to have marriages lawfully performed in another State given full recognition, the Sixth Circuit's decision in favor of State officials is reversed where the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-State.
